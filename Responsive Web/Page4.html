            <hr>
            <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End follows Nathan Drake, now retired from treasure hunting and living a quiet life with his wife, Elena Fisher. His peaceful life is disrupted when his older brother, Sam Drake, who was long believed to be dead, reappears. Sam claims he escaped prison and needs Nathan’s help to find the lost pirate colony of Libertalia and the treasure of the infamous pirate Henry Avery to pay off a dangerous drug lord.

Reluctantly, Nathan returns to the world of thieves, teaming up with Sam and his old partner Victor “Sully” Sullivan. They are pursued by wealthy treasure hunter Rafe Adler and mercenary leader Nadine Ross, who are also searching for Avery’s treasure. The journey takes them across Italy, Scotland, Madagascar, and finally to the hidden pirate utopia of Libertalia.

Nathan eventually discovers that Sam lied about the drug lord, revealing that his brother’s obsession with the treasure drove him to manipulate Nathan into joining the hunt. In Libertalia, the brothers learn that the pirate founders destroyed themselves through greed and betrayal. After a final confrontation with Rafe, Nathan chooses to save Sam instead of the treasure. The game ends with Nathan and Elena reconciling, and years later, they are shown living peacefully with their daughter, Cassie, having truly left their dangerous past behind.</p>
