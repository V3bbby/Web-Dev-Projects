            <p>Nathan Drake is a modern-day treasure hunter who believes he is following in the footsteps of Sir Francis Drake. He searches for the legendary treasure of El Dorado after discovering clues that suggest it was hidden long ago. Nathan teams up with journalist Elena Fisher and his mentor Victor “Sully” Sullivan. Their journey leads them to a mysterious, abandoned island filled with ruins and danger. A ruthless treasure hunter named Gabriel Roman and his mercenaries pursue the same prize. As the search continues, the group uncovers signs that previous explorers met a terrible fate. El Dorado is revealed to be far more dangerous than a simple treasure. Nathan must stop the villains and escape the island alive.</p>
