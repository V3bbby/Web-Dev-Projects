            <h2>Story</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Twenty years after civilization falls, Joel is hired to smuggle Ellie out of a military-controlled zone. What starts as a routine job quickly becomes something much bigger when Joel learns Ellie may be the key to creating a cure.
            The two travel across a devastated America—cities, forests, and ruined towns—encountering infected creatures, brutal human factions, and fleeting moments of beauty and humanity. Along the way, Joel and Ellie form a deep, surrogate father-daughter bond, helping each other survive both physically and emotionally.
            As they grow closer, Joel is forced to confront his past trauma, while Ellie grapples with the weight of her potential importance to the world.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stealth & Combat: Players choose between sneaking past enemies or engaging in tense, brutal combat. Encounters are high-risk due to limited ammo and supplies. Weapons include firearms, melee weapons, and crafted items like Molotovs and shivs</li>

                <li>Resource Management: Scavenging is essential. Materials are used to craft health kits, weapons, and tools, reinforcing a constant sense of scarcity.</li>

                <li>Exploration: Levels are semi-linear with optional areas that reward exploration through upgrades, collectibles, and environmental storytelling.</li>

                <li>Crafting & Upgrades: Players upgrade Joel’s abilities (health, crafting speed, listening mode) and improve weapons at workbenches for better accuracy, damage, and handling.</li>

                <li>Enemies: You face both infected creatures with varied behaviors and human enemies that use tactics like flanking and communication.</li>

                <li>Puzzles & Traversal: Light environmental puzzles—moving objects, ladders, and generators—break up combat and guide progression.</li>

                <li>Companion Gameplay: AI companions, especially Ellie, support the player during exploration and combat without direct control.</li>
