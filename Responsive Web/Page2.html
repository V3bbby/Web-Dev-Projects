            <hr>
            <p>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves follows treasure hunter Nathan Drake as he searches for the lost fleet of Marco Polo and the mythical city of Shambhala.
The story begins with Drake escaping a wrecked train hanging off a snowy cliff, then flashes back to explain how he got there.
Months earlier, he joins his old associate Harry Flynn and former lover Chloe Frazer to steal an artifact linked to Marco Polo.
After Flynn betrays him and frames him for the theft, Drake escapes prison with help from Victor “Sully” Sullivan and journalist Elena Fisher.
Drake learns that ruthless war criminal Zoran Lazarević is also searching for Shambhala to gain its legendary power.
Traveling across Istanbul, Borneo, Nepal, and the Himalayas, Drake uncovers clues revealing that the Cintamani Stone is actually a powerful resin from the Tree of Life.
In the hidden city, Lazarević consumes the tree’s sap to gain superhuman strength, forcing Drake to confront him.
Drake defeats Lazarević and chooses to walk away from the treasure, ultimately reconciling with Elena as Shambhala is destroyed.</p>
