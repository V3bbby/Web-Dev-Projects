Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception follows treasure hunter Nathan Drake as he searches for the lost city of Ubar, also known as the “Atlantis of the Sands.” The story explores Drake’s past, including how he first met his mentor Victor “Sully” Sullivan as a teenager. In the present day, Drake and Sully pursue clues left by Sir Francis Drake that point to Ubar’s location in the Rub’ al Khali desert.

They are opposed by a secretive Hermetic order led by the mysterious Katherine Marlowe and her enforcer Talbot, who seek to harness a powerful hallucinogenic substance hidden within the city. Along the journey, Drake reunites with Elena Fisher and Chloe Frazer, while facing betrayals and dangerous confrontations across London, France, Syria, Yemen, and the Arabian Desert.

Drake eventually discovers that Ubar was destroyed centuries ago after its rulers misused the mind-altering substance found in the city’s water supply. Marlowe attempts to control the substance for her own purposes, but she perishes as the city collapses into a sinkhole. In the end, Drake chooses to abandon the treasure and prioritize his relationships, reconciling with Elena and reaffirming his bond with Sully.</p>
