        <h2>Island Customization</h2>
        <p class="pbig">In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, island customization is a core feature that allows players to fully shape their environment, from the terrain to the smallest decorative details. Players can terraform cliffs and rivers, create paths, and place furniture and trees anywhere on the island. Homes, public spaces, and plazas can be designed with specific themes, while outdoor furniture, flowers, and decorations let players express personal style. The game also allows players to choose island layouts at the start and adjust them over time, giving a sense of long-term creative control. Seasonal events and DIY crafting expand customization options even further. Custom designs can be applied to clothing, flags, and paths, and shared with other players via codes. The island rating system encourages thoughtful planning and aesthetic design. Overall, the system transforms the island into a unique, player-driven world that reflects creativity and personal expression.</p>

        <h2> Crafting and Customization </h2>

        <p class="pbig">
In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, crafting and customization are central gameplay mechanics that allow players to create furniture, tools, and decorations using DIY recipes and gathered materials like wood, stone, and iron. Instead of relying only on store purchases, players actively collect resources and craft items at workbenches, making progression feel more hands-on and survival-focused. Furniture and tools can often be customized with different colors and patterns, adding variety and personal style. Custom design tools let players create and share clothing, flags, signs, and path designs using in-game codes. Seasonal events and updates introduce limited-time DIY recipes, expanding creative possibilities. Crafting encourages exploration and daily activity, while customization allows players to transform both indoor and outdoor spaces. Together, these systems emphasize creativity, personalization, and player-driven design more than any previous entry in the series.
