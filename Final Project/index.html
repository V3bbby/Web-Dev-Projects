        <h2> Western Release </h2>

        <p class="pbig">
The 2002 Western release of Animal Crossing introduced many players in North America to a completely new type of life-simulation game.
Originally released in Japan as Dōbutsu no Mori, the game was localized and adjusted to better fit Western audiences.
Nintendo added new holidays like Halloween and Christmas to make the in-game events more familiar to players outside Japan.
The game ran in real time using the GameCube’s internal clock, meaning seasons and events matched the real world.
Players moved into a small town filled with animal villagers and worked to pay off their home loan to Tom Nook.
Unlike most games at the time, there was no clear ending, allowing players to play at their own pace.
The memory card system allowed multiple players to live in the same town, encouraging shared experiences.
Its relaxing gameplay and charming dialogue helped it gain a loyal fanbase and laid the foundation for future titles in the series.

        <h2> Real Time Clock System</h2>
        <p class="pbig">The real-time clock system in Animal Crossing made the game world move at the same pace as real life.
Day and night changed based on the player’s actual time, so the sun would rise and set in sync with the real world.
The seasons also shifted throughout the year, bringing snow in winter and blooming flowers in spring.
This made the town feel alive and constantly changing rather than static.
Because events only happened at certain times or dates, players felt encouraged to check in regularly.
The time-based gameplay created a sense of responsibility, as villagers would notice if you had been gone for too long.
Psychologically, this system made the game feel personal and immersive, almost like maintaining a real community.
In 2002, this feature felt revolutionary because very few console games connected so closely to real-world time and routine.</p>
