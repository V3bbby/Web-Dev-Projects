            <hr id="line">
            <p>The Last of Us Part II follows Ellie years after the first game as she tries to live a quiet life in Jackson. That peace is destroyed when Joel is brutally murdered by Abby and her group. Overwhelmed by grief and anger, Ellie sets out on a revenge-driven journey to find those responsible. Her time in Seattle becomes increasingly violent, costing her relationships and emotional stability. Midway through the story, the perspective shifts to Abby, revealing that Joel killed her father, a Firefly surgeon. Abby’s side shows how loss shaped her and how she slowly seeks redemption by protecting a boy named Lev. The narrative reframes Ellie and Abby as reflections of each other, both trapped in the same cycle of revenge. Their paths collide again, leading to devastating consequences for everyone involved. In the final confrontation, Ellie gains the upper hand but chooses to let Abby live. She returns home having lost nearly everything, realizing that revenge cannot heal her pain.</p>

            <h2>Weapons</h2>

            <hr id="line">

            <p>In The Last of Us Part II, weapons play a crucial role in shaping how players approach combat, blending stealth, strategy, and raw firepower. Ellie and Abby each have access to a diverse arsenal, from silent bows and crossbows for stealthy eliminations to devastating shotguns and flamethrowers for close-quarters combat. Handguns, semi-automatic pistols, and rifles provide flexible mid-range options, while fully automatic weapons appear later to deliver high-intensity action. Craftable items like Molotov cocktails, stun bombs, and improvised melee tools further expand tactical possibilities, allowing players to manipulate encounters or take down enemies creatively. Weapon upgrades at workbenches enhance damage, accuracy, and stealth capabilities, making every encounter customizable to a player’s style. Ultimately, the careful balance between limited ammo, weapon choice, and upgrade paths encourages a thoughtful, immersive combat experience that rewards both patience and ingenuity.</p>
