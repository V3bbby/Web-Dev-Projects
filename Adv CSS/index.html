            <hr>
            <p>Twenty years after civilization falls, Joel is hired to smuggle Ellie out of a military-controlled zone. What starts as a routine job quickly becomes something much bigger when Joel learns Ellie may be the key to creating a cure.
            The two travel across a devastated America—cities, forests, and ruined towns—encountering infected creatures, brutal human factions, and fleeting moments of beauty and humanity. Along the way, Joel and Ellie form a deep, surrogate father-daughter bond, helping each other survive both physically and emotionally.
            As they grow closer, Joel is forced to confront his past trauma, while Ellie grapples with the weight of her potential importance to the world.</p>

            <hr>

            <ul>
                <li>Stealth & Combat: Players choose between sneaking past enemies or engaging in tense, brutal combat. Encounters are high-risk due to limited ammo and supplies. Weapons include firearms, melee weapons, and crafted items like Molotovs and shivs</li>

                <li>Resource Management: Scavenging is essential. Materials are used to craft health kits, weapons, and tools, reinforcing a constant sense of scarcity.</li>

                <li>Exploration: Levels are semi-linear with optional areas that reward exploration through upgrades, collectibles, and environmental storytelling.</li>

                <li>Crafting & Upgrades: Players upgrade Joel’s abilities (health, crafting speed, listening mode) and improve weapons at workbenches for better accuracy, damage, and handling.</li>

                <li>Enemies: You face both infected creatures with varied behaviors and human enemies that use tactics like flanking and communication.</li>

                <li>Puzzles & Traversal: Light environmental puzzles—moving objects, ladders, and generators—break up combat and guide progression.</li>

                <li>Companion Gameplay: AI companions, especially Ellie, support the player during exploration and combat without direct control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Weapons</h2>

            <hr>

            <p>In The Last of Us Part I, weapons are designed around scarcity and survival rather than power. Firearms include the 9mm pistol, which is reliable and uses common ammo, the revolver that delivers higher damage at the cost of slower handling, the hunting rifle for precise long-range kills, the shotgun for devastating close-quarters combat, the bow as a silent and recoverable-ammo option ideal for stealth, and the high-caliber El Diablo pistol, which appears later in the game and offers extreme stopping power with very limited ammunition. Melee combat relies on fists, throwable bricks and bottles to stun enemies, and environmental weapons like bats, pipes, and planks that break after repeated use, with reinforced versions lasting longer and dealing more damage. The shiv is a critical but limited tool used for stealth executions and opening locked areas. Craftable weapons further emphasize improvisation, including Molotov cocktails for fire-based area damage, nail bombs that act as deadly traps in confined spaces, and smoke bombs that disorient enemies and enable stealth approaches. Altogether, the weapon system supports the game’s core themes of desperation, tactical thinking, and resource management, encouraging players to rely on stealth, positioning, and careful decision-making rather than constant combat.</p>
