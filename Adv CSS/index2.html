        <h2>Adaptation Changes</h2>
    <p>The HBO adaptation of The Last of Us expands on the original game by deepening character backstories and shifting the narrative focus toward emotional and thematic storytelling. The series adds new scenes set before and during the early days of the outbreak, offering greater context for the collapse of society. Several side characters receive significantly expanded storylines—most notably Bill and Frank—transforming brief game segments into fully developed arcs. The show also adjusts pacing, reduces constant combat, and emphasizes human relationships, moral dilemmas, and the cost of survival. While remaining faithful to the core story, the adaptation uses the television format to explore moments and perspectives that were only implied or absent in the games.
